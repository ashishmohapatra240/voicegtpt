# voicegtpt

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project utilizes the ChatGPT API to create an AI-powered voice assistant that can understand and respond to spoken language. The user interacts with the system through voice input, which is then sent to the API for processing. The API generates a response in text form, which is then converted to speech using text-to-speech technology. This allows the user to hear the system's response in a natural and intuitive way. The project also showcases the potential for integrating AI-powered conversational systems into various applications, such as customer service, personal assistants and more.
